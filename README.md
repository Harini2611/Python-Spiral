# Python-Spiral
The project is a simple visualization tool created using Python's turtle module. The goal of the project is to create a colorful spiral that is displayed in a window. The spiral is created using a for loop that sets the pen color, width, and position of the turtle. The pen color is cycled through a list of colors to create a colorful effect. The width of the pen increases as the loop iterates, creating a spiral effect. The turtle is then moved forward by an increasing distance and turned left by a fixed angle to create the spiral shape.

The project is intended to be a simple and fun way to demonstrate the capabilities of the turtle module and provide a visually pleasing example of what can be created with Python. The code can be easily modified to create different shapes and animations, allowing users to experiment and customize the visualization to their liking.
